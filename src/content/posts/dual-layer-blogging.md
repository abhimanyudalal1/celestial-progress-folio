# The Problem with "Blogs"

Every engineer wants a blog. Very few engineers *maintain* a blog.

The reason is simple: **High Bar for Quality.**

When you sit down to write a "Blog Post", you feel the pressure to:
- Be novel
- Be correct
- Be polished
- Be exhaustive

This friction kills momentum.

## The Solution: Two Layers

By splitting your output into **Logs** and **Posts**, you decouple the habit of writing from the burden of quality.

### Layer 1: The Daily Log
It's just for you (and curious observers). It's a stream of consciousness. It proves you are alive and working.

### Layer 2: The Formal Post
This is the "Publication". It's what you share on Twitter/X. It's what goes in your portfolio. You write these only when you have something worth saying, usually synthesized from weeks of logs.

## Conclusion

This new architecture for my site reflects this philosophy. Let's see if it sticks.
