### Fixing the Starfield

Spent way too long today tweaking the `box-shadow` values for the starfield background.

The issue was that the parallax effect was causing some stars to jitter on scroll.

**Solution:**
 moved the stars to a fixed `::before` element, but applied a `transform` on scroll event listener instead of `background-attachment: fixed` on mobile.

Actually, might just revert to the static background for now. It's cleaner.
