the hover mouse can be a spaceship
even ambitious thinking, can i somehow make something that can do some related projects' paths and make a moon automatically- moon= side projects?

make great fucking svgs for the planets
we'll sometime make some blog about the portfolio figuring out the representation of the projects
(this-!?At 25%, you see a small crescent glow.
At 100%, it’s fully lit.)


i know a dwarf planet will be my final shot.

for the progress dilemma we can create a quarter orbit for movement from the progress.
change the planet size, color add glow add more info on hover instead of planets being the project, we can have them being a domain if i dont stop being a generalist
