### Starting the Blog Refactor

Today I started refactoring the blog system to split it into two layers:
1. **Daily Logs**: Raw, unpolished, consistent.
2. **Formal Posts**: Polished, insights.

This structure feels much more sustainable. I don't have to worry about "quality" every day, I just have to ship *something*.

#### Code Snippet Consideration

```typescript
// Ideally, we just import these as raw strings
const modules = import.meta.glob('./*.md', { as: 'raw' });
```

The vibe is going to be crucial here. Need to keep the celestial theme but make the text super readable.
